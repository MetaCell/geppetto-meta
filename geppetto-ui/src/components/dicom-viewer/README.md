## Examples

### Dicom Viewer Example

The following example shows a tissue slice digitally photographed on large-format microscope scanners built at The Brain Observatory. The image in this section was acquired at 20× magnification (resolution: ∼0.4 μm/pixel) resulting in a very large file (dimensions in pixels are: 334,500 × 266,200 and file size on disk 250–400 GB).
