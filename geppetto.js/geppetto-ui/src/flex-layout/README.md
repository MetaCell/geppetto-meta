# Flexible Layout

Flexible Layout (v0.5.2) is a layout manager that lets the developer arrange React components in multiple tab sets that can be resized and rearranged by the end user.

Notable Features:
* Splitters
* Tabs
* Tab dragging and ordering
* Tabset dragging (move all the tabs in a tabset in one operation)
* Dock to tabset or edge of frame
* Maximize tabset (double click tabset header or use icon)
* Tab overflow (show menu when tabs overflow)
* Tab renaming (double click tab text to rename)

```element
